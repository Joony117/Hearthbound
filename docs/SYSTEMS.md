# Systems Reference

The target design. **This is a reference, not a build order.** Each section is tagged with
the phase that implements it — do not build a Phase 4 system during Phase 2 because it was
written down here.

Every number below ends up in `balance.tres`, editable in the inspector without touching
code. The values here are starting points to be tuned against play, not commitments.

## Ranks — *Phase 2*

`F D C B A S SS SSS` → int `0..7`. Applies to heroes and equipment alike.

| Rank | F | D | C | B | A | S | SS | SSS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Stat multiplier | 1.00 | 1.35 | 1.82 | 2.46 | 3.32 | 4.48 | 6.05 | 8.17 |
| Level cap | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 |
| Equipment affixes | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 4 |
| Core sockets | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |

Geometric ×1.35 per rank. An SSS is ~8× an F before levels and gear.

---

## Heroes — *Phase 2*

**Six stats. This is a ceiling, not a starting point.**

`HP`, `ATK`, `DEF`, `SPD`, `CRIT_RATE`, `CRIT_DMG`

A fifteen-stat sheet is a real risk in this genre and nobody can balance one. If a seventh
stat is proposed, it needs a `DECISIONS.md` entry.

```
final = (base + growth * level) * rank_mult + equip_flat
final *= 1.0 + equip_pct
```

### Archetypes

| Archetype | Row | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Knight | Front | Mitigate, hold aggro |
| Rogue | Front | Single-target burst |
| Ranger | Back | Sustained single-target |
| Mage | Back | AoE |
| Cleric | Back | Heal |

**Formation is 3 front / 2 back.** In quick resolve, front row takes a heavier share of
incoming damage. In the arena, it is literal spawn position. Same data, two readings.

---

## Sacrifice → rank up — *Phase 2*

```
yield = essence_base[fodder.rank] * (1.0 + fodder.level / level_cap[fodder.rank])
if fodder.def_id == target.def_id:
    yield *= 3
    target.resonance += 1
```

| Sacrificed rank | F | D | C | B | A | S | SS | SSS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Essence base | 10 | 25 | 65 | 165 | 420 | 1050 | 2600 | 6500 |

| Rank up | F→D | D→C | C→B | B→A | A→S | S→SS | SS→SSS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Essence cost | 40 | 110 | 300 | 800 | 2200 | 6000 | 16000 |

F→D costs four fresh F heroes. SS→SSS costs the equivalent of six fresh SS. Brutally
expensive at the top **by design** — that is the long-term goal of the whole game.

A max-level sacrifice yields double, so levelling fodder before feeding it is a real (if
slow) strategy.

**Rank-up preserves the hero's level and raises the cap.** Resetting level would make
ranking up feel like a punishment. See `DECISIONS.md`.

### Dupes and resonance

Feeding a hero into another instance of the *same* `def_id` grants ×3 essence **and** a
resonance point. Resonance unlocks traits from that hero's definition trait pool at
**1, 3, and 6**.

This is why a duplicate is never dead weight, and it gives chasing a specific unit a payoff
ladder beyond raw stats.

---

## Equipment — *Phase 2, Cores Phase 4*

Ten slots:

`head` `chest` `legs` `gloves` `boots` `main_hand` `off_hand` `necklace` `ring` `belt`

Affix count and socket count come from the rank table. An SSS item is better on three
independent axes at once — higher base, more affixes, larger affix rolls — which is why a
high-rank drop reads as an event.

### Enhancement

- `cost(n → n+1) = 2 + n` parts of matching rank, plus gold
- `+8%` to the item's primary stat per level
- Cap: `min(15, forge_level * 3)`

### Salvage

Breaking an item returns `3 + enhance_level` parts of its rank — roughly half the
investment. Re-gearing is viable but not free.

### Cores — *Phase 4*

Salvaging a rank **A or higher** item always yields one **Core** carrying a rolled unique
effect: lifesteal, on-kill party heal, guaranteed opening crit, and similar.

Cores socket into equipment with free sockets. **Socketing consumes the Core. Unsocketing
destroys it.** No free experimentation — socketing is a commitment.

This is the entire reason to hunt A+ gear you have no intention of wearing.

### Material economy — one rule

**3 parts of rank N convert to 1 part of rank N+1.** At the Forge.

That is the whole system. No per-tier currencies, no conversion matrix, no recipes.

---

## Expeditions — *Phase 2*

`ZoneDefinition`: name, recommended power, wave list, loot table, unlock condition.

Up to 5 heroes. Waves resolve in order; **HP carries forward between waves**. A hero reaching
0 HP is **permanently deleted** — applied in exactly one place (see `ARCHITECTURE.md` rule 8).

`hero_power = ATK + DEF + HP/10 + SPD`, summed across the team. Used for UI warnings and
quick-resolve scaling only. **Never a hard gate** — let players throw units away if they want.

### Retreat threshold

Each expedition carries a retreat threshold, default: bail at 25% party HP.

Three lines of code. It converts permadeath from something that happens *to* the player into
something they gambled on, which is the difference between the mechanic feeling unfair and
feeling tense.

---

## Death and gear recovery — *Phase 2*

A dead hero's equipment does not vanish:

```
LostCache { hero_name, zone_id, items[], turn_lost }
```

**Recovery expeditions** are a distinct mission type targeting one cache. Required power is
`zone.power * 0.5` — deliberately low, so a weak B-team can go fetch a dead SSS hero's gear.
**That is the point of the system**, not an oversight.

Retrieved items may come back **Damaged**:

```
damage_chance = 0.15 + 0.03 * turns_elapsed + power_deficit_penalty
```

Damaged means enhancement halved (rounded down), or if already at `+0`, one affix rolled
down. **Any socketed Cores are lost.**

Caches **expire after 15 turns** (+5 per Reliquary level). The clock is what makes a death
hurt: you choose between pushing progression and mounting a salvage run.

---

## Summoning — *Phase 2*

| Rank | F | D | C | B | A | S | SS | SSS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Weight /10000 | 4000 | 2700 | 1700 | 1000 | 450 | 120 | 28 | 2 |
| Effective | 40% | 27% | 17% | 10% | 4.5% | 1.2% | 0.28% | 0.02% |

Roll a rank from the table, then a random definition from that rank's pool.

SSS at 0.02% is near-mythical on purpose — the design assumes you **build** an SSS through
sacrifice. Pulling one is a lightning strike, not a plan.

Summoning Circle level shifts weight up the table.

**No pity system until Phase 4.** Pity is a player-frustration feature, not a correctness
one, and adding it before the loop is proven would be tuning something that may not survive.

---

## Base buildings — *Phase 2*

Five buildings. **Five integers.** Each read by exactly one system.

| Building | Effect per level | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| Summoning Circle | Shifts summon weight toward higher ranks | summon |
| Forge | Enhance cap `level * 3` (max 15); salvage yield +10% | forge |
| Training Hall | Post-expedition XP +15% | expedition |
| Sanctum | Sacrifice essence yield +10% | sacrifice |
| Reliquary | Cache decay +5 turns; recovery damage chance −3% | recovery |

Upgrade cost: gold + parts.

No build queues, no adjacency bonuses, no timers, no construction animation. Add complexity
only when a building needs to express something an integer can't.

---

## Save — *Phase 2*

`GameSession` → `Dictionary` → `JSON.stringify` → `user://save.json`. Written only by
`SaveService`.

Human-readable and diffable, which matters enormously when a balance change corrupts
progression and you need to see what actually happened.

**Include a `version: int` field from the first commit.** Migration logic is Phase 5, but
retrofitting the field onto existing saves is not something you want to do later.
